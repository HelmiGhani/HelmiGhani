# Hello!

This is Helmi's Github, a place for my projects (be it data analytics or otherwise) that I am working on.

- :globe_with_meridians: You can reach me via [email](helmi.g@hotmail.com) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helmighani/)
- :man_student: Pronouns: He/Him
- :pencil2: Fun fact: I learn how to code using VBA in 2014 when I was tasked with handling lots of data using Excel. Decided to finally transition to Python through a data analytics course held by NTUC LearningHub.
